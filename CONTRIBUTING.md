## Contributing
### What not to do:
- don't make pull requests for things that don't matter for example, changing a spelling mistake in a comment
- don't make troll pull requests
- don't make pull requests that change multiple parts of the code, keep pull requests seperate and organized

### What to do:
- if you are fixing a bug, make sure to only fix one bug not many throughout the code because that can clutter everything up.
- same for features, make them separate pull requests
- comment your code to make the to make the code base more readable
